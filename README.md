# WhatsApp clone

Witness me as I convert this flutter project into a great chatting app suitable for anybody.

## Goals and Features
An important feature I will code into the program from the start is the light and dark
global themes based on system settings.

### This project will also have:
- Basic messaging feature. I will use simple userName to locate users for starters.
- Audio and video messaging service
- Voice and video chat

### Targets:
- Firebase for backend
- BLoC for state management

I will stop working in the UI  for now and try to make the text messaging feature work.
Authentication and firestore, I will need to implement.
